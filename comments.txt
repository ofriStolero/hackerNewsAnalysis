It\u2019s funny that a less confident version of myself found so much optimism when considering powering through a bad situation, but I couldn\u2019t spare any of that optimism if I dreamed of reaching for something higher.<p>#2. \u201cI\u2019m a hard worker and I\u2019ll survive the layoffs through merit\u201d.  Wrong, the truth is that the vast majority of the contractors I worked with were eventually laid off (or resigned) and I don\u2019t think poorly of them for it.  In fact, the few buddies that I have kept in touch with all eventually moved on to better things.  I found the paths they chose after leaving to be inspiring.  They took on more challenging jobs, started graduate school, moved to another city, etc.  I on the other hand quietly worked off the clock on nights and weekends to mitigate my chances of being laid off.  At the time, I told myself that I was acting out of virtue, but really it was fear.  My strategy carried me for a long time, but eventually the psychological impact of being treated as a second rate human being caught up to me.<p>Just sharing my own personal reflections on a very specific set of experiences in case someone finds themselves with similar thoughts.", "SentimentScore": {"Positive": 0.435177206993103, "Negative": 0.19647051393985748, "Neutral": 0.2619451582431793, "Mixed": 0.10640710592269897}}, "26882950": {"text": "It\u2019s ok.
